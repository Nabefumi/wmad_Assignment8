From the list of all existing Functional Interfaces listed above select 3 of the arbitrarily
and come up with one example for eachof them. To this end, for each build-in functional interface,
comeup with a problem and write a short problem descriptionthat can be solved using Functional interfaces
and solve and test itusing lambda expressions (anonymous functions).Look at the example below:

Problem Description: Using BiFunction, write a method which takes two array lists of integer and
append the second array list to the first one and return a new arraylist.
